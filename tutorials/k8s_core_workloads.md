# Kubernetes core workloads

## Workloads

A **Workload** is an application running on Kubernetes.
Whether your workload is a single Docker container, or several containers that work together (e.g. HA mongo cluster), on Kubernetes you run it inside a set of **Pods**.

In this tutorial we will cover the following workloads:

- Pod
- ReplicaSet
- Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> Kubernetes has an [amazing docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), use it. 

### Pods

Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
A Pod is a group of one or more containers (usually one), with **shared storage** and **network resources**, and a specification for how to run the containers.

The following is an example of a Pod which consists of a container running the [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) image.

```yaml
# k8s/pod-demo.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    project: ABC
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: server
    image: nginx:1.26.0
```

To create the Pod shown above, run the following command (the above content can be found in `k8s/pod-demo.yaml`):

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/pod-demo.yaml
```

When a Pod gets created, the new Pod is scheduled to run on a Node in your cluster.
The Pod remains on that node until somthing happens - the Pod finishes execution, the Pod is deleted, the Pod is evicted for lack of resources, or the node fails.

The `labels` attached to the pod can be used to list or describe it.

**Labels** are key/value pairs that are attached to objects such as Pods.
Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users, as well as organizing a subsets of objects.
[Read here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/) about labeling best practice.

```

In the above output we can see a detailed description of the pod.
Reviewing all the presented information can be overwhelmed, but here are a few important notes:

- If you don't specify in which **namespace** to create the Pod object, the `default` namespace is used.
- Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address.
- Pod **events** can help you debug your pod state. 

### Workload resources 

Usually you don't need to create Pods directly. 
Each Pod is meant to run a single instance of a given application. 
If you want to scale your application horizontally, you should replicate the Pod in different nodes. Replicated Pods are usually created and managed as a group by a **Workload Resource**.

Workload resources create and manage multiple Pods for you, with many added benefits.
They handle replication and rollout and automatic healing in case of Pod failure.
For example, if a Node fails, a workload resource notices that Pods on that Node have stopped working and creates a replacement Pod. 

Available workload resources are:

- **Deployment** (and, indirectly, **ReplicaSet**), the most common way to run an stateless applications on your cluster.
- A **StatefulSet** lets you run Pods connected to a persistent storage.
- A **DaemonSet** lets you run single Pod on each Node of your cluster.
- You can use a **Job** (or a **CronJob**) to define tasks that (periodically) run to completion and then stop.

**Note:** Workload resources don't run containers directly, the only object in Kubernetes that does so is the Pod.
All other workload resources **only manage Pods**. For that reason, workload resources are also known as **Controllers**.
In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your Pods, then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current state closer to the desired state.

In this tutorial we will focus on **Deployment** and **ReplicaSet**. 

### ReplicaSet

A **ReplicaSet**'s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.
As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

Here is an example of ReplicaSet:

```yaml 
# k8s/replicaset-demo.yaml 

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
        labels:
          app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: nginx:1.26.0
```

In this example:

- The `.spec.template` field contains a [PodTemplates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-templates). PodTemplates are specifications for creating Pods. As you can see it's very similar to `Pod` YAML described in the previous section.
  We can also notice that pods created from this template hold a label with key `app` and value `nginx`.
- The ReplicaSet creates three replicated Pods, indicated by the `.spec.replicas` field.
- The `.spec.selector.matchLabels` field defines how the created ReplicaSet finds which Pods to manage (remember that ReplicaSet is a controller that manage Pods). In this case, the ReplicaSet will manage all Pods that match the label `app: nginx`, corresponding to the label we gave in the Pod template. 

Let's apply this ReplicaSet in the cluster.

```bash 
kubectl apply -f k8s/replicaset-demo.yaml
```

You can then get the current ReplicaSets deployed:

```bash 
kubectl get rs
```

You can also check for the Pods brought up as part of the ReplicaSet:

```bash 
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```

Let's play with your ReplicaSet:

- Delete one of the pods owned by the ReplicaSet. What happened? 
- A ReplicaSet can be easily scaled up or down by simply updating the `.spec.replicas` field. Try it out...
- Create a Pod (separately to the ReplicaSet) in the cluster, with the same label key and value as you gave in the PodTemplate. What happened? Why? 
- Try to update the image version in the YAML manifest (e.g. to `nginx:1.27.0` or any other available version), and perform `kubectl apply` with the updated YAML file. What happened? Why? 

Delete your ReplicaSet before moving on to the next section:

```bash
kubectl delete replicaset nginx-rs
```

### Deployment

We started our tutorial with a bare Pod, then moved to work with a ReplicaSet.
However, this is not good enough. For example, as you've probability noticed, Replicaset does not automatically update containers when image version is updates. 

A **Deployment** is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features.
In most cases, **ReplicaSet is not being used directly**. Kubernetes' docs recommending using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets.

The following is an example of a Deployment:

```yaml
# k8s/deployment-demo.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
        labels:
          app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: nginx:1.26.0
```

Apply it to your cluster, to see the Deployment rollout status, run `kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx`.

Under the hood, the Deployment object created a ReplicaSet (`rs`) for you:

```console
$ kubectl get rs
NAME                                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-75675f5897                          3         3         3       18s
```

#### Updating a Deployment 

A Deployment's rollout is triggered if and only if the Deployment's Pod template (that is, `.spec.template`) is changed.

Let's update the `nginx` Pods to use the `nginx:1.27.0` image instead of the `nginx:1.26.0` image.
In the Deployment YAML manifest, edit the `.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image` value, and apply again.

Run `kubectl get rs` to see that the Deployment updated the Pods by **creating a new ReplicaSet** and scaling it up to 3 replicas, as well as scaling down **the old ReplicaSet** to 0 replicas.
This actually means that the Deployment manipulate ReplicaSet objects for you.

This process is known as `RollingUpdate`. 

```console
$ kubectl describe deployments nginx
Name:                   nginx
Namespace:              default
CreationTimestamp:      Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:10:41 +0000

    Port:         <none>
    Host Port:    <none>
    Environment:  <none>
    Mounts:       <none>
  Volumes:        <none>
Conditions:

Events:
  Type    Reason             Age   From                   Message

  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  30s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-599c84db5d to 1
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  28s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-976d85c7c to 2 from 3

  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  25s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-599c84db5d to 3 from 2
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  23s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-976d85c7c to 0 from 1
```

If you look at the above Deployment closely, you will see that it first creates a new Pod, then deletes an old Pod, and creates another new one.
It does not kill old Pods until a sufficient number of new Pods have come up, and does not create new Pods until a sufficient number of old Pods have been killed. 


Deployment ensures that only a certain number of Pods are down while they are being updated.
By default, it ensures that at least 75% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% **max unavailable**).

Deployment also ensures that only a certain number of Pods are created above the desired number of Pods.
By default, it ensures that at most 125% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% **max surge**).

When you updated the Deployment, it created a new ReplicaSet (`nginx-599c84db5d`) and scaled it up to 1 and waited for it to come up.
Then it scaled down the old ReplicaSet to 2 and scaled up the new ReplicaSet to 2 so that at least 3 Pods were available and at most 4 Pods were created at all times.
It then continued scaling up and down the new and the old ReplicaSet, with the same rolling update strategy.
Finally, you'll have 3 available replicas in the new ReplicaSet, and the old ReplicaSet is scaled down to 0.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During a RollingUpdate, new versions of an application are gradually rolled out while old versions are gradually scaled down. This means that for a brief period, both the old and new versions of the application may be running concurrently in the cluster.
> this simultaneous running of multiple versions can potentially lead to compatibility issues. For example, if the new version of the application introduces changes to the data schema or format that are incompatible with the old version, it can lead to issues when both versions are accessing the same data store concurrently.


#### Failed Deployment

A Deployment enters various states during its lifecycle.
It can be progressing while rolling out a new ReplicaSet, it can be complete while the Deployment scaled up its newest ReplicaSet, or it can fail to progress.

Sometimes, your Deployment may get stuck trying to deploy its newest ReplicaSet without ever completing. 
This could happen due to various reasons, for example, insufficient resources (CPU or RAM), or image pull errors.

The Deployment will try to reach its desire state for 10 minutes (this value can be changed in `.spec.progressDeadlineSeconds`), after that, the Deployment will indicate (in the Deployment status) that the Deployment progress has stalled.

Let's play with your deployment:

- Scale up and down your deployment
- Try to update the Deployment to the image `nginx:1.27.665`. What happened? How did you resolve?

## Services

Every Pod in a cluster gets its own unique cluster-wide IP address, and Pods can communicate with all other pods on any other node. 

But using Pods IP is not practical. If you use a Deployment to run your app, that Deployment can create and destroy Pods dynamically. 
From one moment to the next, you don't know how many of those Pods are working and healthy; you might not even know what those healthy Pods are named. 
Kubernetes Pods are created and destroyed to match the desired state of your cluster.
Pods are ephemeral resources (you should not expect that an individual Pod is reliable and durable).

Enter **Services**.

The Service is an abstraction to help you expose **groups of Pods** over a network.
Each Service object defines a logical set of **Endpoints** (usually these endpoints are Pods) along with a policy about how to make those pods accessible.

The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a `selector` that you define.

Here is an example for Service exposing port `8080` for all Pods in the cluster labelled by the `app: nginx` key and value (this was the Pod label in the `nginx` Deployment):

```yaml
# k8s/service-demo.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 80
```

Apply the above Service, and describe the created object:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f k8s/service-demo.yaml
service/nginx-service created

$ kubectl describe svc nginx-service
Name:              nginx-service
Namespace:         default
Labels:            <none>
Annotations:       <none>
Selector:          app=nginx
Type:              ClusterIP
IP Family Policy:  SingleStack
IP Families:       IPv4
IP:                10.100.220.135
IPs:               10.100.220.135
Port:              <unset>  8080/TCP
TargetPort:        80/TCP
Endpoints:         10.244.0.48:80,10.244.0.51:80,10.244.0.58:80 + 1 more...
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
```

`Endpoints` are the set of Pods IP that the Service is routing traffic to. 
The controller for that Service continuously scans for Pods that match this selector.

You should now be able to communicate with the `nginx-service` Service on `10.100.220.135:8080` (change the IP to your service IP) from any node in your cluster.
The above created service can be used only for consumption inside your cluster.

The `kube-proxy` (running in every node) ensures that connections to the service's IP are properly routed (or **load balanced**) to the correct pods that belong to the service.


Let's use the `kubectl run` command to create a **temporary** pod name `busybox-client` (based on the useful [`busybox` docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox)) that will communicate with our Nginx service: 

```bash
kubectl run busybox-client --rm --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh -c 'while true; do wget -qO- http://nginx-service:8080; sleep 5; done'
```

### Service DNS 

Kubernetes is shipped with an internal DNS server, called [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/), for resolving addresses and service discovery within the cluster. 
The CoreDNS server is running as a Pod in the `kube-system` namespace. 
It watches the Kubernetes API for new Services and creates a set of DNS records for each one.

Instead of accessing your service by its IP address, you can simply use the Service name as the domain name:

```bash 
curl nginx-service:8080
```

# Exercises 

**Note**: To be done in the order of appearance.

### :pencil2: Deploy the 2048 game

Create a `Deployment` for the 2048 game. You can either push the image you've built in the previous exercise to an ECR and use it, or use an [existed image from DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/evilroot/docker-2048) (the container listens on port 80).
Expose the Deployment with a `Service` listening on port `8080`.
Visit the app locally using `kubectl port-forward` command. E.g.:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/YOUR_SERVICE_NAME 8080:8080
```

### :pencil2: Deploy the "Netflix Service"

In this exercise you deploy the [NetflixMovieCatalog][NetflixMovieCatalog] and the [NetflixFrontend][NetflixFrontend] microservices. 

![][k8s_netflix_simple]

> [!NOTE]
> You can use an existed images: 
> 
> - **NetflixMovieCatalog**: `alonithuji/netflix-movie-catalog:0.0.1`
> - **NetflixFrontend**: `alonithuji/netflix-frontend:0.0.1`

1. Fork and clone both repos locally, open in your preferred IDE.
2. Build a Docker image out of them (you have to create and implement a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of the repo, solution `Dockerfile` in the `dockerfile` Git branch)
3. [Push your images to a DockerHub](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/build-and-push-first-image/) public registry. 
2. Create the following `Deployment`s and the corresponding `Service`s for them:
   - `netflix-movie-catalog` - listens on port `8080`, running in 2 replicas.
   - `netflix-frontend` - listens on port `3000`. In order for the app to fetch movies data, should be provided with an environment variable named `MOVIE_CATALOG_SERVICE` which is the address of the `netflix-movie-catalog` service. 
3. Visit the app locally using `kubectl port-forward` command. E.g.:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/YOUR_NETFLIX_FRONTEND_SERVICE_NAME 3000:3000
```

Open your web browser and enter `http://localhost:3000`. 
You should see the Netflix app with movies info and thumbnails. 

### :pencil2: Add Redis to your Netflix service

In this exercise, you will integrate [Redis](https://redis.io/) into your Netflix service to cache users session data. 
Storing user session data on the server side is useful because it allows to keep sensitive information away from the client, reducing the risk of tampering. 
Additionally, it allows for better scalability and consistency, as session data can be centrally managed in a Redis database, and quickly accessed by different instances of the NetflixFrontend service. 

1. Deploy a [redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) as a `Deployment` (together with the corresponding `Service`) in your cluster. The container is listening on port `6379`. 
2. The [NetflixFrontend][NetflixFrontend] app should be provided with an environment variable called `REDIS_URL` to start storing session data in your redis deployment (e.g. `my-redis:6379`).  


### :pencil2: Grafana and Redis integration

In this exercise you deploy a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) server with [Redis integration](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/redis-datasource/) that present information about your Redis database.  

1. Create a grafana Deployment based on [`grafana/grafana`](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana) docker image, as follows:
  - The Deployment should set the following environment variables:
    - `GF_AUTH_BASIC_ENABLED` with a value equals to `true`.
    - `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER` and `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` variables, to your choice.
    - `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS` with the value `redis-datasource`. This variable pass the plugins you want to install when the container is being launched.
2. Visit the server (you can forward it using the `kubectl port-forward` command).
3. Configure the Redis datasource [as described here](https://redisgrafana.github.io/redis-datasource/configuration/).  
4. In the **Redis** data source page, click on the **Dashboards** tab, and import the `Redis` dashboard. Take a look on the imported dashboard.
