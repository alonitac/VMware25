# Final Assessment

This assignment reflects the knowledge and skills youâ€™ve gained throughout the course.

Some of you may find it easy, while others may find it challenging.

You will set up an HA and vSAN cluster with three hosts, provision multiple virtual machines, and deploy an application within them.

## Guidelines

### Provision infrastructure

- Create 3 ESXi hosts, use the `create-esxi <host-name>` command (while changing `<host-name>` to your hostname), to create a 4CPU and 16GB host with 3 disks as follows:
  - 32GB - to be used by the ESXi OS.
  - 100GB SSD - to be used later by the cache tier of you vSAN cluster
  - 1TB - to be used later by the capacity tier of you vSAN cluster.

- Connect your hosts to the vCenter and create your Data Center.
- Create a HA cluster and add you hosts:
   - It's recommended to start the cluster when HA, DRS, and vSAN are disabled, and enable them later on once the cluster is properly configured.
   - In the `vmk0` configuration of each host of your cluster, set the host IP **to be static**. Also, don't forget to enable desired capability (e.g. vMotion).
   - You can ignore "Warning: no datastore have been configured". Soon you'll configure the vSAN as the **only** datastore in your cluster. 

- Create Distributed Switch with at least 2 groups: 
   - Group for VMs NICs.
   - Group for `vmk0`s management NICs.
   
- Migrate your hosts to the dSwitch. 
- Configure a vSAN cluster:
   - **Don't** enable ENA.
   - Configure the 100GB SSD disk to be the cache tier.
   - Configure the 1TB disk in each host to be the capacity tier. 
   - Make sure your vSAN cluster consist by a single Disk Group (usually named `Group 1`).
   - If you check in health of your cluster (in the skyline health page), the only you should see is `SCSI controller is not certified`. Other than that your cluster should have no issues.
   - You should not configure any other data store in your cluster, except the vSAN shared datastore. 

- Make sure all `vCLS` VMs are running.
- Enable DRS and HA.
- Create a Content Library with the [AlmaLinux OS 9.5 Minimal ISO](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.5/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9.5-x86_64-minimal.iso) image stored in it.
- Create 2 AlmaLinux:
  - 2 CPU, 4GB, 30GB disk
  - Connected to the dSwitch network.
  - When installing it, make sure network is enabled.
  - You can install only 1 machine and clone it to create other VMs easily.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### Make sure you know to answer the following questions:
> 
> - What is the purpose of the 3 different disk sizes in your ESXi configuration?
> - What will happen in the IP of your host will change?
> - What capabilities did you enabled on each **vmkernel interface**? why? 
> - What are the advantages of using a **Distributed Switch** over a **Standard Switch**?
> - What is the name of your VMs and management **port groups**?
> - What is the maximum number of ports that can be configured in your dSwitch?
> - What happen if you disconnect one of your hosts? (do it!).
> - What happens if a vCLS VM stops running?
> - What is a vSAN disk group and why is your cluster configured with a single disk group?
> - What is the primary purpose of HA? and of DRS?



### Deploy application 

In this section you'll deploy a Telegram Bot app that detects objects in images you send to the bot. 

You'll deploy the app in two different ways: (1) as a Docker compose project, (2) In Kubernetes cluster. 

#### Deploying the app as a Docker Compose project

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following `services`: 

- MongoDB (database):
  - Based on the [mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) docker image.
  - Mongo must be persist data in a Docker Volume. 
- YOLO5 (AI service)
  - This app is an AI model that can detects 80 different objects in any natural image you provide. Listens on port `8081`.  
  - Based on the [exit0academy/yolo5:v0.0.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/exit0academy/yolo5) image. 
  - The predictions results are stored in a MongoDB database. The service connects to Mongo using the `MONGO_URL` environment variable (e.g. `mongodb://<your-mongo-hostname>:27017`).
- Polybot (bot service)
  - This app is a Telegram bot. To receive message from Telegram servers into your bot app, you need a **Bot Token**, which is a string that authenticates your bot.
    Obtaining a token is as simple as contacting the `@BotFather` in your Telegram app, issuing the `/newbot` command and following the steps until you're given a new token. You can find a step-by-step guide [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#creating-a-new-bot).
  - Based on the [exit0academy/polybot:v0.0.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/exit0academy/polybot) image. 
  - Communicates with YOLO5 service using the `YOLO5_URL` environment variable (e.g. `http://<your-yolo5-hostname>:8081`).
  - You should provide the image an environment variable `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` with your token value. But since your token is a secret, you cannot provide it as is in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. 
    Instead, create a `.env` file in the same directory of your compose YAML file, as follows:

    ```text
    TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
    ```
  
    Then, you can reference the token value in the compose file by:
  
    ```yaml
    services:
      polybot:
        image: ....
        environment: 
          TELEGRAM_TOKEN: ${TELEGRAM_TOKEN}
    ```


Ensure services are running properly by sending your bot an image and expect for the detected image to be returned. 

# Good Luck
